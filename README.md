# Project 2: Tracking User Activity
## Alex Drossos

As part of the data science test at StudentXServices, we constructed and deployed a data pipeline to enable
new customers to query the data from our assessment delivery service. This GitHub repo contains everything 
a new customer's data science team would need to run queries on our data and understand the pipeline functionality
itself.

In addition to this file, the main folder also includes the docker-compose.yml file and the assessment-attempts JSON
file. As covered in the project report, the docker-compose.yml file is what's used to instruct our virtual machine how
to spin up the data pipeline. The assessment-attempts file is a nested JSON that will be the data pushed through our 
pipeline to eventually be queried.

The /project-2-alexdrossos/reports folder contains the overall project report in .ipynb format as well as our command
line history. The p3_spark.ipynb file is the overall project report. It describes the initial queries we've run and how
we accomplished that using spark SQL. We also describe the pipeline as a whole and some aspects of the data for your reference.
